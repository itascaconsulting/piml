Experiments in physics informed machine learning with Itasca software

order of gridpoints with np.lexsort()

To get weights and bias from TensorFlow ann:
ann1.layers[0].weights[0].numpy().shape
ann1.layers[0].bias.numpy()
Can we export and run the network in sklearn?

Define custom loss function that includes F3 residual
